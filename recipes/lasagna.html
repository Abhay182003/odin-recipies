        <div class="step1">
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Break each lasagna noodle into 6 rectangular pieces. Place noodles in a 4-cup microwave-safe bowl. Add water, making sure noodles are covered and water level is about halfway up the bowl. Place the bowl on a microwave-safe plate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step2">
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Cook in the microwave on high for 2 minutes. Stir pasta quickly to keep it from clumping. Cook in 2-minute increments, stirring in between, and emptying any water that has boiled over onto the plate. Repeat until lasagna is tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes total. Drain noodles, reserving 1 tablespoon of the cooking liquid. Return noodles and reserved liquid to the bowl.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step3">
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Stir marinara sauce and chopped tomatoes into the bowl, mixing until incorporated. Sprinkle on basil, and then mozzarella cheese. Cover surface of the bowl with a paper towel to prevent splatter and microwave until cheese is completely melted and tomato sauce is warmed, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>
